AGILE build environment

We need only 3 environment variables to compile the code

export CFITSIO=<path>
export ROOTSYS=<path>
export AGILE=<path>

And the following variable to run the code of the AGILE Science Tools core

export PFILES=$AGILE/share:$PFILES

To install the system:

git clone https://github.com/AGILESCIENCE/BUILD_GRID_SCI_git.git
cd BUILD_GRID_SCI_git
git checkout <TAGNAME>
./download.sh <username>
./install.sh
./downloadIRF.sh <username>

To recompile the code
./install.sh

To install also agextspot-v2 the OPENCV variabel must be set.
To install also WTOOLS the GSL variable must be set.
