AGILE build environment

We need only 3 environment variables to compile the code

- CFITSIO
- ROOTSYS
- AGILE=~/ADC/scientific_analysis

And the following variable to run the code

export PFILES=$AGILE/share

To install the system

git clone git@github.com:AGILESCIENCE/BUILD_GRID_SCI_git.git
cd BUILD_GRID_SCI_git
./download.sh
./install.sh

To recompile the code
./install.sh
